GLXY

GLXY is an ever-evolving, powerful AI agent framework that seamlessly integrates into your workflows. Combining the latest and greatest open-source tools for programming with generative AI, GLXY weaves together technologies like Fabric, Agent-0, Autogen, Crew AI, Route LLM, OpenAI Swarm, Ollama, LM Studio, and many more into a highly capable framework.

With a feature-rich command-line interface, GLXY gives you full control to automate tasks, manage data, and boost productivity. Custom tooling is added daily, enhancing the system‚Äôs capabilities. Initially tested and developed using a CLI Discord bot, once a need is met or a problem is solved, it‚Äôs baked into an app and packaged for customers.

GLXY is proprietary and serves as the backbone of King Digital Solutions. Interested in integrating GLXY into your applications or life? Visit glxy.dev (coming soon).

üíª Command-Line Interface

GLXY comes with a powerful yet simple command-line interface for easy task deployment.

Command Help

	‚Ä¢	Get Help: Access the help menu to view all available commands.

glxy -h

This command provides a link to the documentation and lists all available commands.

	‚Ä¢	Create Embedding: Generate embeddings from text or a file using an extensive library of crowd-sourced, carefully engineered prompts.

glxy -f <prompt_name> <file_or_text>

This command unlocks endless features as each prompt gives the agents detailed instructions with a large library of tools to complete virtually any task.
Example:

glxy -f article "Your text to make an article"

This instructs the agents to craft an article by:
	‚Ä¢	Using APIs like Perplexity.ai or DuckDuckGo to research the topic.
	‚Ä¢	Reading system.md, a system message that explains industry standards for online articles.
	‚Ä¢	Generating images.
	‚Ä¢	Using a coding environment to create the file.
	‚Ä¢	Hosting it on the web and providing a message in Discord upon successful (or unsuccessful) deployment.

	‚Ä¢	Extract Text from File: Transcribe video content and apply engineered prompts to the transcription.

glxy -tf <prompt> <YouTube_link>


	‚Ä¢	Load File: Upload a file to the directory for processing.

glxy -file <file>

This command uploads a file to the directory. For instance, you can upload an Excel document and then use glxy -c to extract and add data using the code execution tool. The use cases are endless.

	‚Ä¢	Continuous Updates: New commands are added every day to meet customer needs.

# Commands are built for customers, tested via Discord interaction, and then run through the API or made into an app.
